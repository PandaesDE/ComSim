# ComSim [Bachelor thesis]

## Description
This project is the open-source code to my bachelor-thesis project "ComSim" with the title: "Erschaffung einer digitalen Evolutionssimulation mit Vertiefung auf Sozialverhalten" (translated: Creation of a digital evolution-simulation with social behaviour)

## Abstract 
The content of the following thesis deals with the topic of computer simulated eco-
systems with the focus on a certain social behavior acted out by the agents. With
the help of the Unity game engine, a cross-platform software was built, which was
highly inspired by a lifestyle, the hunters and gatherers used to practice during the
lower paleolithic and the upper paleolithic era. In this paper we will look at the his-
torical background of computer simulated ecosystems as well as the paleolithic era,
this simulation was inspired by. To establish some goals and ground rules, the project
planning, implementation, and quality assurance will be discussed, and the methods
used explained. Although it needs to be mentioned that the goal was not to make
a recreation as realistic as possible, but rather to display the statistical relevance of
social structures and the effects on the survival rate of that species.

## Control Settings:
During a Simulation you have the following input options:
|Input|Action|
|---|---|
|[P]|Pause Game|
|[Scroll Up]|Zoom In|
|[Scroll Down]|Zoom Out|
|[LeftMouseButton]|Select Entity|
|While [MiddleMouseButton]|Move Camera|
